SDK documentation is available at:
https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run            -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug          -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-compile        -- compile the plugin
* atlas-package        -- package the plugin
* atlas-install-plugin -- after packaging, deploy the plugin to a running bitbucket instance
* atlas-help           -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
